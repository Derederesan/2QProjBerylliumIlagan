				<h1 id="title" >Burnout</h1>
				<p class="align">The constant feeling of being tired, piles of work to do, and little to none of them getting done sounds like a familiar sensation that most of us experience in our modern-day world. Most of us are so caught up in doing more and more work each day that we eventually exhaust all the energy we used to have and fall into a cycle of lounging around doing nothing all day. This all happens due to burnout, which is an event wherein you experience a large amount of stress in a long period of time.</p>
				<p class="align">It's when you feel that you are so emotionally exhausted with the job that you don’t want to do it anymore. These feelings shouldn’t be confused with any underlying mental illnesses. (These tips in no way are supposed to be used as substitutes for mental illnesses, please consult a doctor if you continue to feel an intense version of burnout. ) So how do you beat this?</p>

					<h2 id="nav1">Getting out of a rut</h2>
				</a>
				
				<p id="weight">1.Motivation is not the answer to everything. </p>
					<p>Despite what most people think, waiting for motivation to come when you’re at your lowest moments is a bad idea. You don’t need motivation in order to do something. In fact, you do something every single day. Motivation doesn’t drive you to open youtube and start scrolling through the endless recommendation of videos. It doesn’t inspire you to get up and grab some food to eat. It doesn’t even inspire you to breathe all the time!</p>
				<p id="weight">2.Gradually do more every day </p>
					<p>Learn to take action even without motivation, and I don’t mean large actions. Start small. Try doing everyday tasks that require a small amount of energy to do, such as taking a shower or cleaning your workspace. These small tasks are just what you need to slowly get you back on track and accomplish things again. </p>
				<p id="weight">3.Reward yourself for small wins</p>
					<p>It sounds stupid to think that rewarding yourself for finally deciding to clean your area is a good idea. It's one of the things that you need in order to get that spark of productivity back inside of you. Rewarding yourself for a job well done isn’t a bad thing, just don’t overdo it. Give yourself small rewards like watching a few episodes of your favorite show on Netflix or eating a snack you love. Your lack of rewards for yourself is one of the things that led you to burn out. </p>	
				<p id="weight">4.Remind yourself about the satisfaction that action brings</p>
					<p>When you feel like you’re slowly slipping back to your old habits, remind yourself of the wonderful feeling that action gives you. It feels fulfilling to know that you got to do so much yesterday, so why shouldn’t you do the same for today?</p>
				<p id="weight">5.Be patient with yourself</p>
					<p>Recovery is slower than you think, but like the saying, good things take time. We need to slowly ease back into our productive selves. If we try to do more than what is needed and force ourselves to work harder, we would only slip back into the world of burnout.</p> 
				<p id="weight">6.Talk to other people</p>
					<p>Lastly, it's important to realize that your feelings are valid. We can’t always be our absolute best 100% of the time. What you’re feeling isn’t something to be ashamed of. Learn to confide in your loved ones and let them know how you’re feeling. Having someone listen to you and comfort you will help you feel better. </p>

					<h2 id="nav2">Avoiding burnout</h2>
					</a>
				<p id="weight">1.Remember your why </p>
					<p>It’s important to realize that although it is good that you get more work done, you shouldn’t push yourself too hard. Learn to find the right balance of work and rest in order to get more done and avoid burnout. It’s easier to take breaks when you are tired than power through and take an even longer break. </p>
			</div>
				<p id="weight">2.Vary your activities throughout your day</p>
				<p>Doing the same thing for extended periods of time can get boring way too fast. You can either choose to break up this activity and schedule it for different periods of your day, or mix it up! Working on the same assessment for 2 hours now? I guess its time to switch it up and work on other pending tasks before getting back to that assessment . </p>
				<p id="weight">3.Give yourself time to relax </p>
				<p>We should always remember the importance of rest. As much as possible, schedule time at the end of your work to do activities that you genuinely enjoy.  We are not machines, we all need rest too.</p>
				
				<p id="weight">4.Keep an eye on your health </p>
				<p>Make sure that your basic needs are met. Food, water, exercise, and sleep are essential in avoiding and recovering from burnout. These four things give us energy throughout our day. Simple exercises such as walking around are already enough, as long as we make sure that we keep our bodies moving. Have around 8 hours of sleep to keep yourself happy and healthy. </p>
				<p id="weight">5.Don’t bite off more than you can chew </p>
				<p>Learn to set standards for yourself. How much work are you able to take without being completely drained of energy? If it's too much for you, drop some of them, you don’t need to tire yourself out. Stop saying yes if you can’t take any more work to do. Be clear with what you want to achieve in life. </p>
				<p id="weight">6.Let go of perfectionism </p>
				<p>Most of the time we overwork ourselves to attain a sense of perfection in our work. Rewriting your work for the 5th time because one sentence seemed off, not submitting your assignment because you’re busy looking for ways to improve it even more, etc. Perfectionism can take up our time and ultimately ruin our lives. We have a harder time receiving feedback, a harder time finishing our work, and a harder time of letting go. Instead, choose to leave your work as it is and learn from your mistakes. </p>
				<p id="weight">7.Leave space in your calendar  </p>
				<p>There are times wherein unexpected things come up, preventing us from following our initial plan. For some people, this could be stressful because they had scheduled their entire day full of activities. To avoid this, remember to leave 1-2 hours free in case of these emergencies, and reschedule when needed. </p>
