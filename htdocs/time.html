				<h1 id="title" >Time</h1>
				<p class="align">Juggling a large amount of work, social life, leisure time and getting enough sleep is what most people deal with on a daily basis. We all have 24 hours in a day, but how we use our time differs from person to person. </p>
				<p class="align">The way we manage our time is essential in making the most out of our day. We can either make or break our day with how we use our time. So it's best to learn how to use it. Here are several tips on how to manage your time better. </p>

				<h2 id="nav1">Determine your priorities</h2>
				</a>
					<p>At most, have three tasks that you must finish before this day is done. No matter what, these three tasks must be accomplished. This ensures that even if you got a little done in a day, you got the most important tasks out of the way. 
					</p>
				<a id="up" href="#logo">
				<div>Back to top</div>
				<h2 id="nav1">Time blocking</h2>
				</a>
					<p>One of the most efficient ways to plan is using this method. You estimate the time it takes for you to work on a certain task. For example, you can choose to work on your assignment in biology from 8 am to 9 am. 
					</p>
					<p>This way of planning applies to Parkinson's law. Where work expands to fill the time allotted for it. If you plan to do your work for a defined amount of time, you're more likely to finish it by that time. To be safe, leave a 15 minute buffer time in between tasks.
					</p>
				<a id="up" href="#logo">
				<div>Back to top</div>
				<h2 id="nav1">Plan the day before </h2>
				</a>
					<p>Making sure that you have a set plan for the next day is crucial for a successful day. This eliminates the time needed to choose what tasks to do. It also enables you to focus more intensely due to the set time limit. 
					</p>
				<a id="up" href="#logo">
				<div>Back to top</div>
				<h2 id="nav1">High and low energy</h2>
				</a>
					<p>Know what times you feel most energized and schedule your important tasks around that time. If you're a morning person, do your most important tasks a few hours after you wake up. The same can be said for night owls. 
					</p>
					<p>Don't forget to set up your relaxation time around periods where you have low energy to maximize the available time you have. 
					</p>
				<a id="up" href="#logo">
				<div>Back to top</div>
				<h2 id="nav1">Don't overschedule</h2>
				</a>
					<p>As the saying goes, "The more you try to do, the less you get to accomplish". Have a specific time limit on certain aspects of your life. You can choose to spend only 7 hours studying, three hours on relaxation and the rest would be for other areas in your life. 
					</p>
					<p>Overscheduling only leads to stress and frustration with not being able to get everything done. If you're not careful, it can also lead to burnout. 
					</p>
				<a id="up" href="#logo">
				<div>Back to top</div>
				<h2 id="nav1">2 minute rule</h2>
				</a>
					<p>If something takes two minutes to do, do it now. Refill your water bottle, wash the dishes, stretch. Do all your needed activities before you get into your work mode and start focusing. This will help get all the other tasks out of the way and prevent you from worrying about them while working.
